# Webhook Tester

With the Webhook Tester app, you can easily test HTTP webhooks and other types of HTTP requests. 

Upon visiting the app, you get a random URL to send your requests and webhooks to, and they're all logged in the app â€“ instantly. Check it out at [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site).

## Requirements

* PHP 7
* Composer
* Web server

## Installation

### Web Server

1. Run the following commands:
   1. `cp .env.example .env`
   2. `php artisan key:generate`
   3. `composer install`
   4. `touch database/database.sqlite`
   5. `php artisan migrate`
2. Setup virtual host pointing to the /public folder.

The above will setup Webhook Tester to use SQLite as a database. If you want to use another database type, take a look in the `config/database.php` file (SQLite will work just fine, even under heavy load.)

### Docker

A Dockerfile is available at hub.docker.com: https://hub.docker.com/r/dahyphenn/webhook.site/.
